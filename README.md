# Analyzing ATP Tennis Tournament Data: Trends & Predictions

## Overview
This project analyzes ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) tennis tournament data from 2013-2023, examining player performance patterns, ranking trajectories, and statistical relationships between various factors in professional tennis. Using Python and statistical analysis, this project answers key questions about tennis player performance and tournament outcomes.

## Dataset
The analysis uses `tennis_atp_3.csv`, containing over 25,000 ATP tennis matches with detailed attributes for each match:
- Tournament name and date
- Tournament series (ATP250, ATP500, Masters 1000)
- Court type (indoor/outdoor) and surface (Hard, Clay, Grass)
- Match information (round, players, winner, rankings, scores)
- Player statistics (rankings, points)

## Research Questions
1. How do players' rankings change throughout their active years?
2. How does player performance against higher-ranked opponents vary across tournament rounds?
3. Can we predict the trajectory of a player's ranking based on historical data?
4. How do win rates between players at specific tournaments differ statistically?
5. Is there a significant relationship between player performance and court surface?

## Methodology
The project employs various analytical techniques:
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Statistical summaries of player rankings
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Match outcome analysis in specific tournaments
- **Regression Analysis**: Trend analysis and visualization of ranking trajectories
- **Variance Analysis**: T-tests comparing player win rates
- **Chi-Square Testing**: Examining relationships between performance and court surfaces

## Key Findings
- Player ranking trajectories provide insights into career development and potential decline
- Statistical significance in performance patterns between different players
- Surface preferences identified for certain players (e.g., Nadal's clay court dominance)
- Win rate comparisons revealing competitive relationships between top players
